# Handbal
## About
Import handball games in your calender. Just download the html file from handbal.be and if you are a fan a Real Kiewit, you can use html2cal.py to convert to an ics. Even better you don't have to, because the files are already in the repository.

## Importing
### On iOS
Opening a link such as [Competition Calender 2021](https://github.com/bclaesen/handbal/raw/master/handbal2021.ics) directly in Mobile Safari on your iPhone will bring up an import dialog. Brave will show this as flat text.

### In Google Calender
Click on add other calenders (+ icon) and either choose import, then upload the file from your computer. Or from url and provide the raw url.

## Quirks and Bugs
* Code should be cleaned for legacy check on DST
* Empty calender output: the label for the Real Team may be updated (again), you can update this easily in the code.
